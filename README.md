# The Prince
My entire body is shivering and my teeth are clattering like crazy. This. Majorly. Sucks. What the hell was I thinking signing up to be an escort?
Ok, focus, Jennifer!
Why did I have to forget my jacket at home? Not only am I making very bad
choices in my life, I’m forgetful as hell, which isn’t helping me at the moment. A ruthlessly frigid gust of wind hits me. I’m beginning to believe I’m going
to die of hypothermia out here. Unless I die of shame -irst. I’d say the odds are roughly 50/50. “Why, hello there, Mr, Cunningham,” I mutter, my voice shuddering. “Oh, my! You are such a sexy thing, aren’t you? I’m Jennifer, and this lovely evening, it’s my pleasure to be your date.” Ugh!

This is beyond ludicrous. But If I want to keep my job, I better follow orders or else… And those are
the precise words I was told to recite by Gary, my new Escorts and Lovers
boss, when I meet my very -irst client. Now if I could just say them with
enough conviction so Ben will actually believe I mean it, that would be great. Why didn’t they include a section in the three-hour escort orientation, teaching me to lie like a pro and go against my feelings?
I run my hands up and down my goosebump-speckled arms, trying to rub any amount of heat into them, because any amount of heat is more than the zero heat I feel in my body at the moment. I’ve been waiting outside the Royal Porter Hotel in downtown Orlando
beneath the overhang for the past thirty minutes. Mr. Cunningham was
supposed to be here twenty minutes ago, at 7:00 p.m., so we could go to
dinner. I should have known. Men who have money and status think the rules
of common courtesy don’t apply to them. Wearing nothing but a black, sequin, spaghetti-strap, scandalously high
above-the-knee length cocktail dress and three-inch black pumps, I have no
defense against the icy gust of air that blasts against me. I scan my surroundings again, but no one looks in the least bit like my -irst client. Ben’s pro-ile says he’s 5’8. In his picture, he has short, dirty blond hair
and ogley hazel eyes. And he looked like a -itness freak, which worries me a bit
since I haven’t seen the inside of a gym, like, ever. However, of all the other women, he chose me, even though I made it very
clear on my Escorts & Lovers pro-ile that I’m not into -itness in the least, and
have a few curves. Maybe it was my waist-long, wavy, dark hair that made him
interested. He said he liked it. Another particularly ruthless gust of wind blasts against me. Oh. My. God! It’s so damn freaking cold!
Forget waiting outside!
I team into the high-end hotel for the fourth time to warm up. Right as I
step through the glass swiveling doors, heat encompasses me. My body
immediately starts to thaw. I head straight for the -ireplace and turn my ass
toward it. “Jennifer! Wow your lips are blue!” Claire Kenyon, my best friend of eleven years, and my co-worker of one, stands up from the leather sectional, her big
blue eyes brimming with concern. She walks over to me and wraps her arms
around to my back, rubbing vigorously. “I’ll be ok,” I say. Claire is here to make sure my very -irst Escorts and Lovers client isn’t some
serial killer or kidnapper. Or both. “You’re quivering like a leaf, you poor thing,” she says. Claire is striking in
every way—tall, slender, blonde, has skin of marble, and is super smart, funny, and sexy. And with a generous monthly allowance from her father, she always
looks like she just walked off the cover of a fashion magazine. Me, I haven’t
been able to afford a new out-it for a couple of years. In fact, the dress I’m
wearing is Claire’s. “He’s still not here yet?” she asks as she pulls away, her irises re-lecting the
-lames in the -ireplace. I shake my head. “No phone call either.” I trust Claire without reservation. Like peas in a pod, we suffered through middle-school humiliation together
and through high school hell, and lately, our friendship has been the glue that
has kept my wreck-of-a life from falling apart. “Well, he certainly doesn’t deserve sex,” she says. “Don’t worry. I’m not a Lover. I’m an Escort.” Her right eyebrow rises. “Which means what again…?”
“My job is to provide good conversation, female company, and perhaps a
make-out session or two.”
“So basically, you’re there to look good on a man’s arm and be his PG-13
date,” she says.
