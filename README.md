# ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The geologicalstructure of that portion ofsouthern Missouri which lies to the westward of
the Archean rocks near the Mississippi River is peculiarly suitable for the development of
caverns. The Ozark uplift produced far-reaching undulations, and there seem to have been
no violent disturbances which would result in extensive faults, considerable displacements, or
a pronounced inclination of the strata. Jointing and pressure cleavage, however, gave rise to
innumerable crevices in the limestone, through which percolating surface water found its way
into all parts of the formations.

By its solvent power this water gradually enlarged the
crevices into passages which, multiplying and uniting, drained constantly increasing areas
until they formed subterranean streams with a perpetualflow. Thus began caverns; and these
grew in depth, width, and height as the rock was eroded and dissolved. Tributary crevices
were subject to the same action; and there was finally created by each of these water
systems a network of cavities whose ramifications sometimes extend throughout several
townships. In time, sections of the roof, here and there, became so thin from the combined
erosion taking place both above and below as to be unable to sustain their own weight; the
overlying strata fell into the cave, and the volume of water flowing through it was augmented
by drainage which had previously been disposed of on the surface. All this had to seek an
outlet somewhere, except in those rare instances where it maintains its downward course
until, below the level of any open stream it can reach, it encounters an impervious stratum
and must lose itself in the deep rocks. Usually, however, it emerges in the face of a bluff or
on the side of a hill; and the opening becomes "the mouth of a cave." Occasionally, in such
situations, the water continues to flow out; but usually it finds a way to reach a lower level,
and so the cave in time becomes dry except for such water as seeps through from the earth
immediately above. Sometimes, too, the point of discharge is at or perhaps somewhat below
the level of a stream into which it passes; in the Ozarks are numerous very large springs or
fountains which by inverted siphon or artesian action are forced up from subterranean
streams lying at a greater depth.
Few large caverns have the floor entirely dry, even when they are well above the bottom
of the valley. Deposits in the front portion may be dry, perhaps dusty on the surface; but
toward the interior moisture usually accumulates until they are muddy or until the water
stands in pools or puddles. When this is the case there is sometimes a little stream making its
way to the front through a channel which it has cut; or seepage may dampen, possibly
saturate, the lowermost portions of the otherwise dry earth. These details are controlled
principally by the direction and degree of slopes and by side openings which allow more or
less of the water to escape at some part of its journey.
When a cavern is fairly lighted and has a dry floor, whether of rock or earth, it forms an
excellent abode for a small community unable or not disposed to construct shelters more
comfortable or convenient; and there is abundant evidence that many caves in the Ozarks
were utilized as habitations by the aborigines. It must be remembered, however, that in the
centuries which have elapsed since hunters or permanent occupants first entered this region,
many superficial changes have taken place, not only about the entrances but within the
caverns as well. Very probably these alterations have converted caves once occupied into places which at present are quite unfit for such purposes. Talus has accumulated in front of
the openings or partially filled the front chambers; it may well be the case that this conceals
much refuse. Caves which, from similar deposits, are now difficult to enter and dark to the
doorway, may have been open and convenient. Furthermore, caves with wet or muddy
bottoms may owe such condition to causes which have recently come into operation; or if
they always contained more or less water, the primitive dwellers could in many cases have
overcome such disadvantages by digging drains which have since become choked and
obliterated. Very small cavities, such as deep rock-shelters; or caverns with a great
thickness of earth on the floors, now showing no trace of remains; or those with entrances
so small that it is necessary to crawl through—any of these, if cleared out to the bottoms,
might disclose material dating back to very early times.
It might seem that the air in a cave constantly occupied would grow stale and close; while
smoke from the fires would in time become annoying. But Indians used for fuel only dry
wood and bark, the smoke from which would be a negligible factor. The varying pressure of
the atmosphere outside creates a current of air in or out which is usually imperceptible but
which penetrates to the deepest recesses and insures ventilation.
In view of the very primitive conditions under which cave dwellers lived, as denoted by
the artificial objects which they left, and the low mentality indicated by the skulls, Mr. W.H.
Holmes suggests that a careful and extended study of these abodes may disclose a culture
lower than that prevailing among out-door dwellers in the same localities. As no effort would
be required to secure warmth and shelter, and as food was abundant and easily procured,
the people may never have advanced from savagery, or may have retrograded.
None of these possibilities are taken into account when reporting upon the caves
described in the following pages; the information offered is based entirely upon the present
appearance of the places mentioned. To attempt more would be merely offering guesses.
If "Cave Man"—using this term to designate the predecessor of any race or tribe known
to history—ever existed in the Mississippi Valley he would not find in any part of it natural
features better adapted for his requirements than in the Ozark hills. But, so far, not the
slightest trace of his presence has been revealed. Products of human industry have been
reported as occurring at great depths under other conditions, even at the bottom of the
loess; though in all such cases there is some uncertainty as to the correctness of the
observations. No similar reports have been made in regard to any cave yet explored. On the
contrary, whatever may be the depth of the deposit containing them, the artificial objects
exhumed are uniform in character from top to bottom; the specimens found on the clay or
solid rock floor are of the same class as those barely covered by the surface earth.
Moreover, when they cease to appear they cease absolutely; the rock was swept bare, or
the clay was deposited, by the stream to which the cave owes its existence, and each is a
part of the originalformation. In these circumstances habitation would be out of the question.
